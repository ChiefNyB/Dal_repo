    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sing a song of celebration, lift up a shout of praise,<br/>For the bridegroom will come, the glorious one,<br/>And oh, we will look on His face.<br/>We'll go to a much better placce.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Dance with all your might, lift up your hands<br/>And clap for joy, the time's drawing near,<br/>When He will appear, and oh, we will stand by His side<br/>A strong, pure, spotless bride.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh, we will dance on the streets that are golden,<br/>The glorious bride and the great son of man.<br/>From ev'ry tongue and tribe and nation will join<br/>In the song of the Lamb.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Sing aloud for the time of rejoicing is near.<br/>(ladies repeat)<br/>The risen King, our groom, is soon to appear.<br/>(ladies repeat)<br/>The wedding feast to come is now near at hand.<br/>(ladies repeat)<br/>Lift up your voice, proclaim the coming Lamb.<br/>(ladies repeat)<br/></lines>
