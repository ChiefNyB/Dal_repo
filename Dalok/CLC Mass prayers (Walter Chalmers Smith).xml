    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>Come Holy Spirit and burn with Holy desire within me, that in humility of heart and expectant faith, free of the opinions of others we may be defenceless against every word and action of you my God in this glorious celebration of our salvation and everlasting Joy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>Oh Lord let us draw near with ardent desire, may you utterly consume our sin and illumine our hearts that we may be enflamed and deified by participation in the divine fire.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1c">
      <lines>Now Lord consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. <br/>Stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders for the name of your holy servant Jesus.</lines>
