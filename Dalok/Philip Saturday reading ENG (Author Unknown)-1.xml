    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Brothers and sisters:<br/>Someone may say, "How are the dead raised?<br/>With what kind of body will they come back?"<br/>You fool!<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>What you sow is not brought to life unless it dies.<br/>And what you sow is not the body that is to be<br/>but a bare kernel of wheat, perhaps, or of some other kind.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>So also is the resurrection of the dead.<br/>It is sown corruptible; it is raised incorruptible.<br/>It is sown dishonorable; it is raised glorious.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>It is sown weak; it is raised powerful.<br/>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.<br/>If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual one.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>So, too, it is written,<br/>"The first man, Adam, became a living being,"<br/>the last Adam a life-giving spirit.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>But the spiritual was not first;<br/>rather the natural and then the spiritual.<br/>The first man was from the earth, earthly;<br/>the second man, from heaven.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>As was the earthly one, so also are the earthly,<br/>and as is the heavenly one, so also are the heavenly.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>Just as we have borne the image of the earthly one,<br/>we shall also bear the image of the heavenly one.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
