    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Grander earth has quaked before<br/>Moved by the sound of His voice<br/>And seas that are shaken and stirred<br/>Can be calmed and broken for my regard</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>And through it all, through it all<br/>My eyes are on You<br/>And through it all, through it all<br/>It is well<br/>And through it all, through it all<br/>My eyes are on You<br/>And it is well, with me</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Far be it from me to not believe<br/>Even when my eyes can't see<br/>And this mountain that's in front of me<br/>Will be thrown into the midst of the sea</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>So let go my soul and trust in Him<br/>The waves and wind still know His name<br/>The waves and wind still know His name<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>And it is well<br/>With my soul<br/>It is well<br/>With my soul<br/>It is well<br/>With my soul<br/>It is well, it is well with my soul</lines>
    </verse>
