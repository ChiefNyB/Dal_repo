    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty,<br/>Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.<br/>He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,<br/>And trembles at his voice, trembles at his voice.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How great is our God, sing with me,<br/>How great is our God, all will see,<br/>How great, how great is our God.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,<br/>Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.<br/>The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,<br/>The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Name above all names,<br/>Worthy of all praise,<br/>My heart will sing<br/>How great is our God.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
