    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>With me, bear the hardships for the sake of the Good News,<br/>relying on the power of God<br/>who has saved us and called us to be holy â€“<br/>not because of anything we ourselves<br/>have done but for his own purpose and by his own grace.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>This grace had already been granted to us,<br/>in Christ Jesus, before the beginning of time,<br/>but it has only been revealed<br/>by the Appearing of our saviour Christ Jesus.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He abolished death, and he has proclaimed life<br/>and immortality through the Good News.<br/></lines>
