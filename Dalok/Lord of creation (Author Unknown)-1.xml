    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lord of creation, to you be all praise!<br/>Most mighty your working, most wondrous your ways!<br/>Your glory and power are beyond us to tell<br/>and yet in the heart of the humble you dwell.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord of all power, I give you my will,<br/>in joyful obedience your tasks to fulfil.<br/>Your bondage is freedom; your service is song;<br/>and, held in your keeping, my weakness is strong.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lord of all wisdom, I give you my mind`<br/>Truth that surpasses our knowledge to find.<br/>What eye has not seen and what ear never heard<br/>Is taught by your Spirit and shines from your Word.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lord of all bounty, I give you my heart<br/>I praise and adore you for all you impart<br/>Your love to inflame me, your council to guide<br/>Your presence to shield me, whatever betide<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Lord of all being I give you my all<br/>If I should disown you, I'd stumble and fall<br/>But sworn in your service your word I'll obey<br/>And walk in your freedom to the end of the way<br/></lines>
    </verse>
