    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've heard the accusation <br/>and I've heard the propaganda<br/>I've heard the lies they've whispered to my soul<br/>That I have been forsaken<br/>And I'll always be forgotten<br/>No matter what I do it's not enough<br/><br/>But then I heard a voice as it opened up the heavens<br/>reminding me of who i've always been<br/><br/>I am your beloved, You have bought me with your blood<br/>And on your hand, you've written out my name<br/>I am your beloved, the one the Father loves<br/>Mercy has defeated all my shame<br/><br/>There's no accusation, or any condemnation<br/>When I look into my father's eyes<br/>They don't see my sin, they only see redemption<br/>This is how my heart has been defined<br/><br/>I can hear a voice that is louder than the thunder<br/>Reminding me of who I've always been<br/><br/>The one who knows me best<br/>Is the one who loves me most<br/>There is nothing I have done<br/>That will change the Father's love.<br/></lines>
