      <lines>We come to You with a heart of thanks, for your love<br/>To be a living sacrifice, brought with love<br/>We come to You with a heart of thanks, for Your love<br/>An offering of all we are, brought with love<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>All creation, looks to You<br/>All provision, comes from You<br/>In every sunrise, hope shines through<br/>For Your mercy, we thank You<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We come to You with a song of praise, for Your love<br/>The music of our soul's delight, brought with love<br/>We come to You with a song of praise, for Your love<br/>Sounds of joy and gratefulness, brought with love<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>All creation looks to You<br/>All provision comes from You<br/>In every rhythm we thank You<br/>(In every season we thank You)<br/>For Your love<br/></lines>
