      <lines>For salvation's in this place<br/>You're the name by which we're saved, Jesus, Jesus<br/>Let Your name be lifted high<br/>As our thankful hearts now cry, "Jesus, Jesus"<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lift up your heads, you ancient gates<br/>Be lifted up, you ancient doors<br/>The King is coming in, the King is coming in<br/>We lift up a shout to shake the skies<br/>Lift up a cry, "Be glorified!"<br/>The King is coming in, the King is coming in<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We're the people of God with a song to sing<br/>And we're bringing our lives as an offering<br/>We will dance for Your glory, Lord<br/>And Your cross is the hope that we hold up high<br/>As we tell the whole world of Your love and life<br/>We will dance for Your glory, Lord<br/></lines>
