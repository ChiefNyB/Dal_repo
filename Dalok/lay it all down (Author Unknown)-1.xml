    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lay it all down<br/>will Regan<br/>Verse 1<br/>Bring your worry, grief and pain<br/>Every cause you have for shame<br/>Lay it all down, lay it all down<br/>When your cares have buried you<br/>And thereâ€™s nothing left to do<br/>Lay it all down lay it all down<br/>At the feet of Jesus, at the feet of Jesus<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Carried on but your heart was tired<br/>Feared the worst and felt the fire<br/>lay it all down, lay it all down<br/>Filled with all those anxious thoughts<br/>all your doubts became your god<br/>lay it all down, lay it all down<br/>at the feet of Jesus, at the feet of Jesus<br/></lines>
