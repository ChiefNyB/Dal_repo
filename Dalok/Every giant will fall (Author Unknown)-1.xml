    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I can see the Promised Land<br/>Though there's pain within the plan<br/>There is victory in the end<br/>Your love is my battle cry<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When my fears, like Jericho<br/>Build their walls around my soul<br/>When my heart is overthrown<br/>Your love is my battle cry<br/>The anthem for all my life<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Every giant will fall, the mountains will move<br/>Every chain of the past, You've broken in two<br/>Over fear, over lies, we're singing the truth<br/>That nothing is impossible with You (woah)<br/>With You (woah<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>There is hope within the fight<br/>In the wars that rage inside<br/>Though the shadows steal the light<br/>Your love is my battle cry<br/>The anthem for all my life<br/></lines>
    </verse>
