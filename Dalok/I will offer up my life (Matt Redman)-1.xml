    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I will offer up my life in spirit and truth<br/>Pouring out the oil of love<br/>As my worship to you<br/>In surrender I must give my every part<br/>Lord, receive this sacrifice of a broken heart<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring<br/>To so faithful a Friend, to so loving a King?<br/>Saviour, what can be said, what can be sung<br/>As a praise of Your name<br/>For the things You have done?<br/>Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part<br/>Of the debt of love that is owed<br/>By this thankful heart<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You deserve my every breath,<br/>For You've paid the great cost<br/>Giving up your life to death,<br/>Even death on the cross.<br/>You took all my shame away,<br/>There defeated my sin<br/>Opened up the gates of heaven<br/>And have beckoned me in.<br/></lines>
