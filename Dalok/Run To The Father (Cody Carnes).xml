    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've carried a burden <br/>For too long on my own<br/>I wasn't created<br/>To bear it alone<br/>I hear your invitation<br/>To let it all go<br/>I see it now<br/>I'm laying it down<br/>And I know that I need you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I run to the Father<br/>I fall into grace<br/>I'm done with the hiding<br/>No reason to wait<br/>My heart needs a surgeon<br/>My soul needs a friend<br/>So I'll run to the Father<br/>Again and again</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You saw my condition<br/>Had a plan from the start<br/>Your Son for the redemption<br/>The price for my heart<br/>And I don't have a context<br/>For that kind of love<br/>I don't understand<br/>I can't comprehend<br/>All I know if I need you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="o1">
      <lines>Again and again <br/>And again and again</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>My heart has been in your sights<br/>Long before my first breath<br/>Running into your arms<br/>Is running to life from death<br/>And I feel this rush deep in my chest<br/>Your mercy is calling out<br/>Just as I am You pull me in<br/>And I know I need You now</lines>
    </verse>
