      <lines>We have nothing to give that didn't first come from Your hands<br/>We have nothing to offer You which You did not provide<br/>Every good, perfect gift comes from Your kind and gracious heart<br/>And all we do is give back to You what always has been Yours<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lord, we're breathing the breath that You gave us to breathe<br/>To worship You, to worship You<br/>And we're singing these songs with the very same breath<br/>To worship You, to worship You<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who has given to You that it should be paid back to him?<br/>Who has given to You as if You needed anything?<br/>From You and to You and through You come all things, O Lord<br/>And all we do is give back to You what always has been Yours<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lord, we're breathing the breath that You gave us to breathe<br/>To worship You, to worship You<br/>And we're singing these songs with the very same breath<br/>To worship You, to worship You<br/></lines>
