    <verse name="v1a">
      <lines>Do you feel the world is broken (we do)<br/>Do you feel the shadows deepen (we do)<br/>Do you know that all the dark won't stop the light from getting through?<br/>(we do)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>Is all creation groaning? (it is)<br/>Is a new creation coming? (it is)<br/>Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst? (it is)<br/>Is it good that we remind ourselves of this? (it is)</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1c">
      <lines>Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole? Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll? <br/>The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave<br/>He was David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1d">
      <lines>Is He worthy? Is He worthy?<br/>Of all blessing and honour and glory?<br/>Is He worthy of this? He is</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1e">
      <lines>Does the Father truly love us? (He does)<br/>Does the Spirit move among us? (He does)<br/>And does Jesus our Messiah hold forever those He loves? (He does)<br/>Does our God intend to dwell again with us? (He does)</lines>
