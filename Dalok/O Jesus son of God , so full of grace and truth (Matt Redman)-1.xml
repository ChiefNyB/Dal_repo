    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You shone upon the earth, but who will under stand?<br/>You came unto Your own, but who will recog nise?<br/>Your birth was prophesied, for You were the Messiah<br/>Who came and walked upon the Earth<br/>Your glory we have seen, the one and only King<br/>And now You're living in our hearts<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>In You all things were made and nothing without You<br/>In heaven and on earth all things are held in You<br/>And yet You became flesh, living as one of us<br/>Under the shadow of the cross<br/>Where, through the blood you shed, You have made peace again<br/>Peace for a world that God so loves<br/></lines>
