    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>reproaches us for transgressions of the law<br/>and charges us with violations of our training.<br/>Let us see whether his words be true;<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>let us find out what will happen to him.<br/>For if the just one be the son of God, God will defend him<br/>and deliver him from the hand of his foes.<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>With revilement and torture let us put the just one to the test<br/>that we may have proof of his gentleness<br/>and try his patience.<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Let us condemn him to a shameful death;<br/>for according to his own words, God will take care of him.<br/></lines>
