    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've lived stories that have proved Your faithfulness<br/>I've seen miracles my mind can't comprehend<br/>There is beauty in what I can't understand<br/>Jesus it's you Jesus it's You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I believe you're the wonder working God<br/>You're the wonder working God<br/>All the miracles I've seen<br/>Too good to not believe</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>You're the wonder working God<br/>You heal because You love<br/>All the miracles we'll see<br/>You're too good to not believe</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I can't resurrect a man with my own hands<br/>But just the mention of Your name can raise the dead<br/>All the glory to the only One who can<br/>Jesus it's You Jesus it's You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1a">
      <lines>I've seen cancer dissapear<br/>I've seen metal plates desolved<br/>Don't you tell me He can't do it<br/>Don't you tell me He can't do it<br/>I've seen real life resurrection<br/>I've seen mental health restored<br/>Don't you tell me He can't do it<br/>Don't you tell me He can't do it</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1b">
      <lines>I've seen families reunited<br/>I've seen prodigals returned<br/>Do'nt you tell me He can't do it<br/>Don't you tell me He can't do it<br/>I've seen troubled souls delivered<br/>I've seen addicts finally free<br/>Don't you tell me He can't do it<br/>Don't you tell me He can't do it</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1c">
      <lines>We'll see cities in revival<br/>And salvation flood the streets<br/>Don't you tell me He can't do it<br/>Don't you tell me He can't do it<br/>We'll see glory fill the nations<br/>Like the world has never seen<br/>Don't you tell me He can't do it<br/>Don't you tell me He can't do it</lines>
    </verse>
