    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>For He has regarded the lowly estate of His handmaid,<br/>Behold, henceforth all ages will call me blessed,<br/>For He who is mighty has done great things for me.<br/>Holy His Name!<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And His mercy is on those who fear Him thru' ages.<br/>He has shown strength with His arm,<br/>And the proud He has scattered.<br/>The mighty He put down the lowly have been exalted.<br/>Holy His Name!<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The hungry He has filled the rich sent empty away.<br/>Israel He has helped remembering His mercy.<br/>His promise to Abraham and our fathers forever.<br/>Holy His Name!<br/></lines>
