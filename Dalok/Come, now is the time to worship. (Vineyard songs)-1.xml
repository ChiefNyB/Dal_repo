    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come, now is the time to worship.<br/>Come, now is the time to give your heart.<br/>Come, just as you are, to worship.<br/>Come, just as you are, before your God.<br/>Come.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>One day every tongue will confess<br/>You are God.<br/>One day every knee will bow.<br/>Still the greatest treasure remains for those<br/>Who gladly choose you now.<br/></lines>
