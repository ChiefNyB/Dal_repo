    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Who is there like You?<br/>And who else would give their life for me<br/>Even suffering in my place?<br/>And who could repay You?<br/>All of creation looks to You<br/>And You provide for all You have made<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>So I'm lifting up my hands<br/>Lifting up my voice<br/>Lifting up Your name<br/>And in Your grace I rest<br/>For Your love has come to me<br/>And set me free<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And I'm trusting in Your word<br/>Trusting in Your cross<br/>Trusting in Your blood and all Your faithfulness<br/>For Your power at work in me is changing me.<br/></lines>
