    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh Spirit of God,   take my heart and take my soul –<br/>I give them to You, take control, take control<br/>Oh Spirit of God,    take my heart and take my soul –<br/>I give them to You, take control, take control<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When I find my soul is weak and   I can’t find the words to speak<br/>Jesus would You let Your love fall?<br/>So I offer this simple prayer – for Lord I know You are always there<br/>I’m carried by Your   Holy  Sp   –   ir   -   it<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When I can’t pray and I can’t stand, Spirit take me by the hand<br/>So I can walk through this valley of death<br/>Though I am gone and I am lost – You died for me, Jesus You paid the cost!<br/>Come and bring me back to life again!<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So let Your love come fall upon us,           come let Your love invade<br/>For You came as one among us         and now the price is paid     (repeat)<br/></lines>
