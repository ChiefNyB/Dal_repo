    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Brothers and sisters:<br/>For those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.<br/>For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear,<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>but you received a Spirit of adoption,<br/>through whom we cry, Abba, Father!<br/>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit<br/>that we are children of God,<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>and if children, then heirs,<br/>heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ,<br/>if only we suffer with him<br/>so that we may also be glorified with him.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
