    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Step by step we're moving forward<br/>Little by little taking ground<br/>Every prayer a powerful weapon<br/>Strongholds come tumbling down and down and down<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We're gonna see, we're gonna see<br/>We're gonna see Jesus lifted high<br/>We're gonna see, we're gonna see<br/>We're gonna see Jesus lifted high<br/></lines>
