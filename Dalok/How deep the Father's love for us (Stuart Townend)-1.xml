    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How deep the Father's love for us,<br/>How vast beyond all measure,<br/>That He should give His only Son<br/>To make a wretch His treasure.<br/>How great the pain of searing loss -<br/>The Father turns His face away,<br/>As wounds which mar the Chosen One<br/>Bring many sons to glory.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Behold the man upon a cross,<br/>My sin upon His shoulders;<br/>Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice<br/>Call out among the scoffers.<br/>It was my sin that held Him there<br/>Until it was accomplished;<br/>His dying breath has brought me life -<br/>I know that it is finished.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I will not boast in anything,<br/>No gifts, no power, no wisdom;<br/>But I will boast in Jesus Christ,<br/>His death and resurrection.<br/>Why should I gain from His reward?<br/>I cannot give an answer;<br/>But this I know with all my heart -<br/>His wounds have paid my ransom.<br/></lines>
