    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A place to find comfort, a place to find peace<br/>Where we see your mercy, I'm covered by grace<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You made a way, when there was no way, there was no way<br/>You made a way when there was no way, there was no way<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You tore the veil,  and I'm welcomed in.<br/>To enter Your throne room, with no weight of sin<br/>I sit at Your feet Lord, where I'm truly free<br/>My life  in the Truth, Your awesome Love for me<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>There's Glory in this place, and power in Your name<br/>Where all can find healing, here Jesus You reign<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>There is nothing  in this world, no powers above or below<br/>Nothing in all of creation, that will take me from Your love<br/></lines>
