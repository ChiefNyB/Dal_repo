    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Oh, the love of my Lord is the essence<br/>Of all that I love here on earth.<br/>All the beauty I see, He has given to me,<br/>And his giving is gentle as silence.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Every day, every hour, every moment,<br/>Have been blessed by the strength of His love.<br/>At the turn of each tide, He is there at my side,<br/>And his touch is as gentle as silence.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There've been times when I've turned from his presence,<br/>And I've walked other paths, other ways,<br/>But I've called on his name, in the dark of my shame<br/>And his mercy was gentle as silence.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He has poured out his spirit upon me<br/>He has turned all my world upside down<br/>And his peace and his calm<br/>Fills my soul like a balm<br/>And his healing is gentle as silence<br/></lines>
    </verse>
