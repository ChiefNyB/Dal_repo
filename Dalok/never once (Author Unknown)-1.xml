    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Scars and struggles on the way<br/>But with joy our hearts can say<br/>Never once did we ever walk alone<br/>Carried by Your constant grace<br/>Held within Your perfect peace<br/>Never once, no, we never walk alone<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Every step we are breathing in Your grace<br/>Evermore we'll be breathing out Your praise<br/>You are faithful, God, You are faithful<br/>You are faithful, God, You are faithful<br/></lines>
