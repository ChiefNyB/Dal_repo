    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The moon and stars they wept<br/>The morning sun was dead<br/>The Saviour of the world was fallen<br/>His body on the cross<br/>His blood poured out for us<br/>The weight of every curse upon him<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>One final breath he gave<br/>As heaven looked away<br/>The son of God was laid in darkness<br/>A battle in the grave<br/>The war on death was waged<br/>The power of hell forever broken<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The ground began to shake<br/>The stone was rolled away<br/>his perfect love could not be overcome<br/>Now death where is your sting?<br/>Our resurrected King<br/>Has rendered you defeated<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Forever he is glorified<br/>Forever he is lifted high<br/>Forever he is risen<br/>He is alive, He is alive!<br/></lines>
    </verse>

      <lines>We sing hallelujah<br/>We sing hallelujah<br/>We sing hallelujah<br/>The Lamb has overcome<br/></lines>
