    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Who is like unto Him, never ending in days;<br/>He is the Lord.<br/>And He comes in power when we call on His name.<br/>He is the Lord.</lines>

      <lines>Show Your power, O Lord our God (repeat)<br/>Our God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Your gospel, O Lord, is the hope for our nation;<br/>You are the Lord.<br/>It's the power of God for our salvation.<br/>You are the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>

      <lines>We ask not for riches, but look to the cross;<br/>You are the Lord.<br/>And for our inheritance give us the lost.<br/>You are the Lord.</lines>
