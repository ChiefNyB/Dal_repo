    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We have overcome the world by the blood of the Lamb<br/>And loving not ourselves even unto death<br/>The word of our testimony tells the world about His love<br/>As we shout to the nations, He is coming back!<br/>Oh, He is coming back!<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Through the blood of our Savior we are set free from the curse<br/>Jesus is the one and only lasting sacrifice.<br/>He has conquered Satan's power, no more shall we be ashamed<br/>Just as He defeated death, we shall never die!<br/>No we shall never die!<br/></lines>
