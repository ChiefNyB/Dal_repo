    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In every heart there is a throne, It’s in a place that is reserved for God alone.<br/>And as we live, it forms within, Built by the choices that are worthy of a king.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>It’s made of mercy to the weak;<br/>A voice that’s given to the one who cannot speak.<br/>And of compassion to the poor,<br/>Relief of suffering that others must endure.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In every heart…<br/>In every kindly word we say,<br/>Each time we bend the knee before the lord and pray,<br/>The wounded soul we choose to love,<br/>When we forgive and ask for mercy from above.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>In every heart…<br/>And every idol we refuse,<br/>Each chain we break and every captive we set loose.<br/>When we proclaim Your Holy Word,<br/>And bring your light of truth into a fallen world.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Take your place, take your place, take your place, upon Your throne…<br/></lines>
    </verse>
