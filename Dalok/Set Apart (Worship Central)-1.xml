    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Separated from that body bound in sin... (free from bondage...)<br/>and crucified with Christ, that man no longer lives. (revived...)<br/>Purify me. (Purify me.) Let my life testify that Your death was enough.<br/>Purify me. (Purify me.) Let Your Kingdom on earth, match Your Kingdom above.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I've been broken out of slavery. Sin has no right to me.<br/>I've been broken out of slavery. And You, my King, have made me free.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We will not conform to a world that celebrates our self-destruction.<br/>We will not conform, because we know we were born for revolution.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Separated from that body bound in sin... (free from bondage...)<br/>and crucified with Christ, that man no longer lives. (revived...)<br/>Purify me. (Purify me.) Let my life testify that Your death was enough.<br/>Purify me. (Purify me.) Let Your Kingdom on earth, match Your Kingdom above.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Age to age, You're calling me to holiness.<br/>And age to age, the standard is for righteousness to mark this life.<br/>So teach me how to turn my heart away from the worthless things that I've kept so near.<br/>Teach me how to turn my heart away until Your voice is all that I hear.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>We will fight to change this system. We will not conform. We will not conform.<br/>We will not conform. (We will not conform...) We will not conform. (We will not conform...)<br/></lines>
