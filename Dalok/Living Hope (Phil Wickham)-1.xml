    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How great the chasm that lay between us<br/>How high the mountain I could not climb<br/>In desperation I turned to heaven<br/>And spoke Your name into the night<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Then through the darkness Your loving kindness<br/>Tore through the shadows of my soul<br/>The work is finishhed the end is written<br/>Jesus Christ my Living Hope<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Who could image so great a mercy<br/>What heart could fathom such boundless grace<br/>The God of Ages stepped down from Glory<br/>To wear my sin and bear my shame<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The cross has spoken I am forgiven<br/>The King of Kings calls me His own<br/>Beautiful Saviour I'm Yours forever<br/>Jesus Christ my Living Hope<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Hallelujah praise the One who set me free<br/>Hallelujah death has lost its grip on me<br/>You have broken every chain there's salvation in Your Name<br/>Jesus Christ my Living Hope<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Then came the morning that sealed the promise<br/>Your buried body began to breathe<br/>Out of the silence the Roaring Lion<br/>Declared the grave has no claim on me<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Then came the morning the sealed the promise<br/>Your buried body began to breathe<br/>Out of the silence the Roaring Lion<br/>Declared the grave has no claim on me<br/>Jesus Yours is the victory<br/></lines>
