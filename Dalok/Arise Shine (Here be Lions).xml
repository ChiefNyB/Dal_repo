    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We speak hope to the hopeless<br/>Freedom to captives<br/>In the name of the Father and Son<br/>We speak healing to heartbreak<br/>Peace to the restless<br/>Your salvation has come<br/><br/>Arise and shine<br/>Come out of the darkness<br/>Walk out of your chains<br/>Arise and shine<br/>Come and give Him worship<br/>Glorify His name<br/><br/>We speak life to the desert<br/>And death to our bondage<br/>In the name of the Father and Son<br/>We speak power in weakness<br/>This is our witness<br/>That our Saviour has won<br/><br/>This is the sound of a people<br/>Coming awake coming awake<br/>This is the sound of a people<br/>Shouting Your praise shouting Your praise<br/></lines>
