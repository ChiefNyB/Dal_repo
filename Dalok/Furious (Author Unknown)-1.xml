    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Nothing can tear us from<br/>The grip of His mighty love<br/>We've only glimpsed, His vast affection<br/>Heard whispers of, His heart and passion<br/>It's pouring out...<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His love is deep, His love is wide, And it covers us<br/>His love is fierce, His love is strong, It is furious<br/>His love is sweet, His love is wild<br/>And its waking hearts to life<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Father loves and sends His son<br/>The Son lays down His life for all<br/>He lavishes His love upon us<br/>He calls us now, His sons and daughters<br/>He's reaching out...<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>... and its waking hearts to life<br/>He is waking hearts to life<br/>He is waking hearts to life<br/></lines>
