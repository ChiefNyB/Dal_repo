      <lines>Let everything that has breath<br/>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord<br/>Let everything, let everything that has breath<br/>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1b">
      <lines>I'll praise in the valley, praise on the mountain <br/>I'll praise when I'm sure, praise when I'm doubting<br/>I'll praise when outnumbered, praise when surrounded<br/>'Cause praise is the waters my enemies drown in</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1a">
      <lines>As long as I'm breathing<br/>I've got a reason to<br/>Praise the Lord, oh my soul<br/>Praise the Lord, oh my soul</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'll praise when I feel it, and I'll praise when I don't <br/>I'll praise 'cause I know You're still in control<br/>'Cause my praise is a weapon, it's more than a sound<br/>Oh, my praise is the shout that brings Jericho down</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1b">
      <lines>Praise the Lord, oh my soul<br/>Praise the Lord, oh my soul</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1c">
      <lines>I won't be quiet, my God is alive<br/>So how could I keep it inside?<br/>Praise the Lord, oh my soul</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v1d">
      <lines>I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign, praise 'cause You reign<br/>Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave<br/>I'll praise 'cause You're faithful, praise 'cause You're true<br/>Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You<br/>I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign, praise 'cause You reign<br/>Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave<br/>I'll praise 'cause You're faithful, praise 'cause You're true<br/>Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You</lines>
