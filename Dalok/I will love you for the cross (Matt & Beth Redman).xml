    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I will love you for the cross<br/>And I will love you for the cost<br/>Man of sufferings<br/>Bringer of my peace<br/>You came into a world of shame<br/>And paid the price we could not pay<br/>Death that brought me life<br/>Blood that brought me home<br/>Death that brought me life<br/>Blood that brought me home<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And I love you for the cross<br/>I'm overwhelmed by the mystery<br/>I love you for the cost<br/>That Jesus you would do this for me<br/>When you were broken, you were beaten,<br/>You were punished, I go free<br/>You were wounded and rejected<br/>In your mercy - I am healed<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus Christ the sinner's friend<br/>Does this kindness know no bounds<br/>With your precious blood you have purchased me<br/>Oh the mystery of the cross<br/>You were punished you were crushed<br/>But that punishment has become my peace<br/>Yes that punishment has become my peace<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>(By your wounds I am healed<br/>For the cross, for the cross, for the cross I thank you<br/>Oh Lord, for the cross, for the cross)<br/></lines>
