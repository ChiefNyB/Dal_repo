    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The spirit came into me and made me stand up,<br/>and I heard the Lord speaking to me.<br/>He said, ‘Son of man,<br/>I am sending you to the Israelites,<br/>to the rebels who have turned against me.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Till now they and their ancestors<br/>have been in revolt against me.<br/>The sons are defiant and obstinate;<br/>I am sending you to them, to say,<br/>“The Lord says this.”<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Whether they listen or not,<br/>this set of rebels shall know<br/>there is a prophet among them.’<br/></lines>
