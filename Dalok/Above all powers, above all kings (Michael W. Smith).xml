    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Above all powers, above all kings<br/>Above all nature and all created things<br/>Above all wisdom and all the ways of man<br/>You were here, before the world began<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Above all kingdoms, above all thrones<br/>Above all wonders the world has ever known<br/>Above all wealth and treasures of the earth<br/>There's no way to measure what you're worth<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Crucified, laid behind a stone<br/>You lived to die, rejected and alone<br/>Like a rose, trampled on the ground<br/>You took the fall and thought of me<br/>Above all<br/></lines>
    </verse>
