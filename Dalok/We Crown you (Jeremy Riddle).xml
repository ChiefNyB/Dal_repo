    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>To the One who wore<br/>A crown of thorns<br/>To the One who took<br/>The lash and scourge<br/>For the hands and feet<br/>That were pierced by nails<br/>For the sacrifice<br/>That has torn the veil<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>We crown You!<br/>We fall face down and we worship!<br/>We all cry out "You are worthy God!"<br/>"You are worthy, God!"<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>To the One who gave<br/>His very life away<br/>Who took upon Himself<br/>All our guilt and shame<br/>Hanging on a cross<br/>For the world He loved<br/>With His precious blood<br/>Purchased men for God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>To the One<br/>Who endured<br/>All the shame of the cross<br/>To the Lamb<br/>Who was slain<br/>As atonement for us<br/>To the Son<br/>Who overcame<br/>All the power of death<br/>We praise...</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>For the stripes<br/>For the wounds<br/>For the beating You bore<br/>For the tears<br/>For the blood<br/>That was willingly poured<br/>For the merciful, wonderful, majesty of Your love!</lines>
