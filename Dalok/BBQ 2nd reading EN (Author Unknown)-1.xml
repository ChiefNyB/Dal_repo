    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In view of the extraordinary<br/>nature of these revelations,<br/>to stop me from getting too proud<br/>I was given a thorn in the flesh,<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>an angel of Satan to beat me and stop me<br/>from getting too proud!<br/>About this thing,<br/>I have pleaded with the Lord three times<br/>for it to leave me,<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>but he has said,<br/>‘My grace is enough for you:<br/>my power is at its best in weakness.’<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So I shall be very happy<br/>to make my weaknesses my special boast<br/>so that the power of Christ may stay over me,<br/>and that is why I am quite content with my weaknesses,<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>and with insults, hardships, persecutions,<br/>and the agonies I go through for Christ’s sake.<br/>For it is when I am weak that I am strong.<br/></lines>
