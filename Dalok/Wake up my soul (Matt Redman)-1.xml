    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Wake up my soul,<br/>Worship the Lord of truth and life<br/>Have strength my heart,<br/>Press on as one who seeks the prize.<br/>I'll run for You, my God and King,<br/>I'll run as one who runs to win.<br/>I'm pressing on, not giving in.<br/>I will, I will run, for You my King!<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And Spirit come, give life to us,<br/>Come breathe the Father's love in us.<br/>Won't You fill us once again,<br/>And we will run and run with Him.<br/>We'll run with strength, with all our might,<br/>We'll fix our eyes on Jesus Christ;<br/>He has conquered death and sin,<br/>And we will run and run and run with Him.<br/></lines>
