    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like<br/>But I've heard tender whispers of love in the dead of night<br/>And you tell me that you're pleased<br/>And that I'm never alone<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You're a Good, Good Father<br/>It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are<br/>And I'm loved by you<br/>It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I've seen many searching for answers far and wide<br/>But I know we're all searching<br/>For answers only you provide<br/>Cause you know just what we need<br/>Before we, we say a word<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>You're a Good, Good Father<br/>It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are<br/>And I'm loved by you<br/>It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Love so undeniable I can hardly speak,<br/>Peace so unexplainable I can hardly think,<br/>As you call me deeper still,<br/>As you call me deeper still<br/>Into love, love love.<br/></lines>
