    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've lived stories that have proved Your faithfulness<br/>I've seen miracles my mind can't comprehend<br/>And there is beauty in what I can't understand<br/>Jesus, it's You, Jesus, it's You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I believe<br/>You're the wonder-working God<br/>You're the wonder-working God<br/>All the miracles I've seen<br/>Too good to not believe</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>You're the wonder-working God<br/>And You heal because You love<br/>Oh, the miracles we'll see<br/>You're too good to not believe<br/>Too good to not believe</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And I can't resurrect a man with my own hands<br/>But just the mention of Your name can raise the dead (yeah)<br/>All the glory to the only One who can<br/>Jesus, it's You, Jesus, it's You</lines>
