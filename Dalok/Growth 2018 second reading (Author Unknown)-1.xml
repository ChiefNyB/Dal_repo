    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Brothers and sisters:<br/>Every priest stands daily at his ministry,<br/>offering frequently those same sacrifices<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>that can never take away sins.<br/>But this one offered one sacrifice for sins,<br/>and took his seat forever at the right hand of God;<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>now he waits until his enemies are made his footstool.<br/>For by one offering<br/>he has made perfect forever those who are being consecrated.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Where there is forgiveness of these,<br/>there is no longer offering for sin.<br/></lines>
