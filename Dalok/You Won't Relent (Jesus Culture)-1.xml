      <lines>You won't relent until You have it all,<br/>My heart is Yours<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I'll set You as a seal upon my heart<br/>as a seal upon my arm<br/>For there is love that is as strong as death<br/>Jealousy, demanding as the grave<br/>And many waters cannot quench this love<br/><br/>Come be the fire inside of me<br/>Come be the flame upon my heart<br/>Come be the fire inside of me<br/>Until You and I are One</lines>
