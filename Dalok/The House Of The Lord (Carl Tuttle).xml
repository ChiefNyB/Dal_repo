    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We have come to celebrate,<br/>we have come to sing of Your great Power<br/>and the glory of Your name.<br/>You have set the captives free,<br/>You have made the blind eyes see,<br/>to the poor You have proclaimed good news.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In the house of the Lord,<br/>where Your children come to dance and sing,<br/>In the house of the Lord,<br/>we rejoice in all the things You've done.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We have come to worship You,<br/>to give praise and thanks to You,<br/>Knowing that You've only just begun.<br/>You have touched us by Your grace,<br/>Lord, we long to see Your face,<br/>to be with You for all eternity.<br/></lines>
