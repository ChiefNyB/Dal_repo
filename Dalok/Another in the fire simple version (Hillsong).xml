    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There's a grace when the heart is under fire<br/>Another way when the walls are closing in<br/>And when I look at the space between<br/>Where I used to be and this reckoning<br/>I know I will never be alone<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>There is another in the fire<br/>Standing next to me<br/>There is another in the waters<br/>Holding back the seas<br/>And should I ever need reminding<br/>What power set me free<br/>There is a grave that holds no body<br/>And now that power lives in me<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>There is another in the fire<br/>There is another in the fire<br/>There is another in the fire<br/>There is another in the fire<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>I can see the light in the darkness<br/>As the darkness bows to him<br/>I can hear the roar in the heavens<br/>As the space between wears thin<br/>I can feel the ground shake beneath us<br/>As the prison walls cave in<br/>Nothing stands between us<br/>Nothing stands between us<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>There is no other name<br/>But the name that is Jesus<br/>He who was and still is<br/>And will be through it all<br/>So come what may in the space between<br/>All the things unseen<br/>And this reckoning<br/>I know I will never be alone<br/>I know I will never be alone<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>There'll be another in the fire<br/>Standing next to me<br/>There'll be another in the waters<br/>Holding back the seas<br/>And should I ever need reminding<br/>How good You've been to me<br/>I'll count the joy come every battle<br/>Cause I know that's where You'll be<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>I'll count the joy come every battle<br/>Cause I know that's where You'll be<br/>I'll count the joy come every battle<br/>Cause I know that's where You'll be<br/></lines>
