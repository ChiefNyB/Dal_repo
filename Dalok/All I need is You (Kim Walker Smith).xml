    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I left my fear by the side of the road<br/>Hear you speak you won't let go<br/>Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray<br/>Got every reason to be here again<br/>Father's heart that draws me in<br/>And my eyes want to see is a glimpse of you</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="p1a">
      <lines>All I need is You<br/>All I need is You lord, is you Lord<br/><br/>All I need is You<br/>All I need is You lord, is you Lord</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>One more day and it's not the same<br/>The spirit that make my heart to sing<br/>Drawn to the voice of my Saviour once again<br/>Would my soul be without your Son<br/>Gave his life to save the earth<br/>Rest in the thought that You're watching over me</lines>
    </verse>
