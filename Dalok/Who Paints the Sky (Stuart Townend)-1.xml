      <lines>Who paints the skies into glorious day?<br/>Only the splendour of Jesus<br/>Who breathes His life into fists of clay?<br/>Only the splendour of Jesus<br/>Who shapes the valleys and brings the rain?<br/>Only the splendour of Jesus<br/>Who makes the desert to live again?<br/>Only the splendour of Jesus<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Who hears the cry of the barren one?<br/>Only the mercy of Jesus<br/>Who breaks the curse of the heart of stone?<br/>Only the mercy of Jesus<br/>Who storms the prison and sets men free?<br/>Only the mercy of Jesus<br/>Purchasing souls for eternity?<br/>Only the mercy of Jesus<br/></lines>
