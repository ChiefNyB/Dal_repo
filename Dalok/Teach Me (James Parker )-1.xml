      <lines>Teach me that my life is not my own<br/>Teach me that my life does not belong to me<br/>Teach me how to yield to You my selfish control<br/>Teach me how to live with those around me<br/>Teach me how to die to<br/>All that I think's best for me<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>You are Lord, You are my saviour<br/>I am Yours, I am Your servant<br/>You are Lord, and I must follow You<br/>Wherever You choose to lead me<br/>My life is not my own, my Lord, it's Yours<br/></lines>
