    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>ask from one end of the sky to the other:<br/>Did anything so great ever happen before?<br/>Was it ever heard of?<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Did a people ever hear the voice of God<br/>speaking from the midst of fire, as you did, and live?<br/>Or did any god venture to go and take a nation for himself<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>from the midst of another nation,<br/>by testings, by signs and wonders, by war,<br/>with strong hand and outstretched arm, and by great terrors,<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>all of which the LORD, your God,<br/>did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?<br/>This is why you must now know,<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>and fix in your heart, that the LORD is God<br/>in the heavens above and on earth below,<br/>and that there is no other.<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>You must keep his statutes and commandments that I enjoin on you today,<br/>that you and your children after you may prosper,<br/></lines>

    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>and that you may have long life on the land<br/>which the LORD, your God, is giving you forever.<br/></lines>
