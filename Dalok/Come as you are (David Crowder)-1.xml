    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come out of sadness<br/>From wherever you've been<br/>Come broken hearted<br/>Let rescue begin<br/>Come find your mercy<br/>Oh sinner come kneel<br/>Earth has no sorrow<br/>That heaven can't heal<br/>Earth has no sorrow<br/>That heaven can't heal<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lay down your burdens<br/>Lay down your shame<br/>All who are broken<br/>Lift up your face<br/>Oh wanderer come home<br/>You're not too far<br/>So lay down your hurt<br/>Lay down your heart<br/>Come as you are<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's hope for the hopeless<br/>And all those who've strayed<br/>Come sit at the table<br/>Come taste the grace<br/>There's rest for the weary<br/>Rest that endures<br/>Earth has no sorrow<br/>That heaven can't cure<br/>Earth has no sorrow<br/>that heaven can't cure<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lay down your burdens<br/>Lay down your shame<br/>All who are broken<br/>Lift up your face<br/>Oh wanderer come home<br/>You're not too far<br/>So lay down your hurt<br/>Lay down your heart<br/>Come as you are<br/>Come as you are<br/>Fall in his arms<br/>Come as you are<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>There's joy for the morning<br/>Oh sinner be still<br/>Earth has no sorrow<br/>That heaven can't heal<br/>Earth has no sorrow<br/>That heaven can't heal<br/></lines>
