    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He is jealous for me,<br/>Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,<br/>Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When all of a sudden,<br/>I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,<br/>And I realise just how beautiful You are,<br/>And how great Your affections are for me.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And oh, how He loves us, oh,<br/>Oh, how He loves us,<br/>How He loves us all<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He is jealous for me,<br/>Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,<br/>Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>When all of a sudden,<br/>I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,<br/>And I realise just how beautiful You are,<br/>And how great Your affections are for me.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>And oh, how He loves us, oh,<br/>Oh, how He loves us,<br/>How He loves us all<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v7">
      <lines>Yeah, He loves us,<br/>Oh, how He loves us,<br/>Oh, how He loves us,<br/>Oh, how He loves.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v8">
      <lines>And we are His portion and He is our prize,<br/>Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes,<br/>If His grace is an ocean, we're all sinking.<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v9">
      <lines>And Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,<br/>And my heart turns violently inside of my chest,<br/>I don't have time to maintain these regrets,<br/>When I think about the way...<br/></lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v10">
      <lines>He loves us,<br/>Oh, how He loves us,<br/>Oh, how He loves us,<br/>Oh, how He loves.<br/></lines>
